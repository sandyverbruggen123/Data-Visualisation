# Assignment 2: Births in Belgium 

## Process
I had the idea to make a circle of boys and girls who represent the amount of girls and boys who are born in that year and the amount of baby's born in the different months of the year. When there were more girls born in a year, it would be a girl and if there are less girls born than boys, it would be a boy. But that plan failed because there are always more boys born in Belgium.

To create this data visualisation I used Illustrator. I drawed the boys with different shapes like the circle and rectangle and then I combined them with the Shape Builder Tool. To make the donut chart (bottom visualisation) and the pie chart (top visualisation) I used the Pie Graph Tool. I adapt the shape of the graphs a bit so they would fit in the boy. Then I made all the parts by lassercutting them. 

## Goal
The goal is that you can see that there always will be more boys who are born than girls and you can see the difference of born boys and girls together per month.
