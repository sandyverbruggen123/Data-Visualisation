# Assignment 3

## Process
The data set I found had more than 100.000 rows. So I have chosen only the fastest cars of Mario with an sql query. <br>

I wanted to show something like a race track. I searched for a data visualisation that looks most like this. And I found an Sankey diagram. First I drew all nodes and links and this result was a nice symmetric visualisation. But all the tracks were in the same color so you couldn't see the right combinations. So I give for every diferent category of the kart every track another color. This was the result made in html and javascript.

<br>

After this I edited the visualisation in Illustrator. I rotated it because otherwise the text in the nodes wasn't readable.

Data from: https://data.world/databeats/mario-kart-8-deluxe-kart-stats/workspace/file?filename=KartKross.csv

## Goal
I wanted to show the different combinations of the fastest karts from Mario in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. In other Mario Kart games you have to choose just your kart but in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe you have to choose a kart, tires and a glider. So if you want the fastest car in the game, you have to follow one of the "race tracks" on the poster in one color. The thickness of the tracks shows the weight of the kart. So now if you see this visualisation, you can choose the options that fits best for you.
