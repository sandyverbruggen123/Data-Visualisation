# Assignment 5: Weather data sonification

## Process
First a loades the data in to Processing, send the data via open sound control to pure data. In pure data I receive the data from the temperature, clouds, humidity, snow, wind, name of the capital. The sounds change according these data.  <br>
Temperature changes pitch from oscilator <br>
Clouds changes the roomsize of the reverb  <br>
Humidity changes noise <br>
Wind change speed of a sample made in Reaper <br>
Snow --> ...  <br>
I also made an visualisation in pure data to show the name of the capital en the description of the weather

## Goal
I wanted to make sounds according to weather data from different capitals and create dynamic soundwaves.  

## Properties
Explanatory - Linear - Auditive - Node-based

## Final result
