# Assignment 5: Weather data sonification

## Process
First a loades the data in to Processing, send the data via open sound control to pure data. In pure data I receive the data from the temperature, clouds, humidity, snow, wind, name of the capital. The sounds change according these data.  
Temperature changes pitch from oscilator
Clouds changes the roomsize of the reverb  
Humidity changes noise
Wind change speed of a sample made in Reaper
Snow --> ...  
I also made an visualisation in pure data to show the name of the capital en the description of the weather

## Goal
I wanted to make sounds according to weather data from different capitals and create dynamic soundwaves.  

## Properties
Explanatory - Auditive - Node-based

## Final result
