# Assignment 5: Weather data sonification

## Process
First a loades the data in to Processing, send the data via open sound control to pure data. In pure data I receive the data from the temperature, clouds, humidity, snow, wind, name of the capital. The sounds change according these data.
Temperature --> pitch 
Clouds --> reverb 
Humidity --> noise
Wind --> sample
Snow --> ...
I also made an visualisation in pure data to show the name of the capital en the description of the weather

## Goal

## Properties
Explanatory - Auditive - Node-based

## Final result
