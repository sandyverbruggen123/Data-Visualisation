# Assignment 4: Travel globe Belgium

## Process
This data visualisation was made in three.js. First I drew the globe with a texture map of the earth where you can see the continents and oceans. Then I drew with three geosjon all the countries on the globe. These didn't match with the texture map. So after some puzzling, I rotated the globe the right degrees. Then I searched a formule to change the coordinates to points on the globe. I also searched for a formule to calculate a point between two points on the sphere. This was necessary because otherwise I couldn't draw a curve from Belgium to a popular destination. After this I designed everything and used Amcharts to draw some extra info in 3D.

## Goal
I wanted to show on a real globe the most popular travel destinations of Belgians. Now you can see the most popular destinations and the height of the curves show also the distance, how higher, how farther away from Belgium. 

## Properties
Explanatory - Interactive - 3D
