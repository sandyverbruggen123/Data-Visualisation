# Assignment 4: Travel globe Belgium

## Process
This data visualisation was made in three.js. First I drew the globe with a texture map of the earth where you can see the continents and oceans. Then I drew with three geosjon all the countries on the globe. These didn't match with the texture map. So after some puzzling, I rotated the globe in the right degrees. Then I searched a formule to change the coordinates (lat & lon)to points on the globe. I also searched for a formule to calculate a point between two points on the sphere. This was necessary because otherwise I couldn't draw a curve from Belgium to a popular destination. I also used trackballcontrolls to rotate and zoom in or out on the globe. Now you can zoom in ann rotate the globe in any direction. In this way you can follow any destination. After this I designed everything and used Amcharts to draw some extra info in a 3D donut chart.

## Goal
I wanted to show on a real, interactive globe the most popular travel destinations of Belgians. Now you can see the most popular destinations and the height of the curves show also the distance, how higher, how farther away from Belgium. You can rotate the globe and you can zoom in or out. 

## Properties
Explanatory - Interactive - 3D
