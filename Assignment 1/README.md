# Assignment 1: Meteorite Landings

## Process 
I found an interesting dataset about meteorite landings. I wanted them to show on the right position because I had the coordinates. So I placed them with D3 on a X,Y scatter plot. You could see a map of the world reversed. So I reversed it in D3 and tried to draw a worlp map behind the meteorites. This didn't work on the whole world, if there was one continent right then another changed so I have put a map of the world next to this data visualasition. In this way you can see the link between them. 

## Goal
Show all fall meteorites on the right place and if you choose one meteorite you can see more information about it. The dots are scaled according the mass of the meteorite and the color shows the year. 

## Properties
Exploratory - Interactive - D3

## Final result
